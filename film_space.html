              <p>
                Booking unique venues for photoshoots or film shoots can seem
                intimidating or stressful. For example, people in the industry
                gate keep locations to prevent the masses from using the same
                location. This can discourage young film makers or photographers
                from expanding their talents to a more professional atmosphere.
              </p>
              <h3>Solution</h3>

                Film Space offers a friendly platform that allows users to
                easily search for locations based on their individual needs.

          <h2>My Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            I followed a Lean UX design process to help me gather information to
            create the final UI. I was fortunate to interview actual users to
            gather their input which enhanced the design process.

                In this stage of my design process, my goal was to investigate
                my users and their pain points, so I conducted a
                <strong> competitive analysis and User Interviews. </strong>

                archetypical model of a user who will interact with my product.
                I then <strong>defined an MVP</strong> to work more efficiently

              To measure the efficiency of the overall design for Film Space, I
              conducted a usability test with actual users. I gave the
              participants a set of tasks to complete and had them verbally
              explain their thought process. After conducting the tests with the
              participants, I synthesized their comments to aid me in improving
              my prototypes.

                  much information was needed to arrive at the browsing page. I
                  could streamline the process and include everything on one
                  page instead of two pages.

                  too many options for filtering and it could be cleaned up to

          <h2>Retrospective</h2>
          <h3>What Went Well</h3>
          <p>
            I’m quite happy with my overall design and I’m proud of this project
            being my first full-length UX/UI design project. Going into this
            case, I wanted to design a tool that solves a problem I am familiar
            with. So I chose to design Film Space because I am familiar with the
            pain points of the film making audience. I was able to communicate
            my problem statement well and with the help of my user testers, I
            was able to come up with a proposed design solution.
          </p>
          <h3>What didn't go well</h3>
          <p>
            Initially I went into this project with a mobile-first approach, and
            I felt it was difficult to make my designs responsive to web and
            tablet screens. I think practicing designing different responsive
            apps would help me overcome this, as well as doing more research on
            current popular responsive web apps, such as Airbnb.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Moving forward I want to continue getting constant feedback
            throughout my design process like how I managed to do with this
            case. Even though this was a self-made UX/UI case, I enjoyed
            receiving constant feedback through user interviews and user testing
            to keep my motivation high and help me through any parts where I
            felt stuck.
