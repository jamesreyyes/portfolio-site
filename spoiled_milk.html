        <h2> Project Context </h2>
        <p> Having a cluttered fridge is a mess. No longer will you hold off throwing away that expired ranch dressing on the fride shelf. Spoiled Milk is here to help you manage your goods! </p>
        <h3> Problem </h3>
        <p> Families at home easily forget what's inside their fridge. They can have food that has been in there for months and not notice a thing. The food ends up wasted or someone in the house will eat it and risk getting sick! </p>
        <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p>To prevent more food being wasted, I created Spoiled Milk. This app helps people be aware of the food in their fridge by reminding them when something is about to expire. To help users get the most of their ingredients, the app will offer
          recipes based on the food inside their fridge. </p>
        <h3> My Roles </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Research </li>
          <li> User Flow </li>
          <li> Wireframes </li>
          <li> UI Design </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> My Process </h2>

        <p> Setting these goals helped me define the brand and the overall goals of the app. In doing so, I was able to fabricate the app’s key features while adhering to the message of the brand. </p>
        <h3> Research </h3>
        <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on two popular apps currently on the market. “Cooklist” and “Pantry Check” are similar to Spoiled Milk and analyzing these apps helped me define the strengths and weaknesses of my competition.
          Understanding these gaps helped me create better design solutions to provide an enhanced experience for my app’s users. </p>

        <h3> Prototype </h3>
        <h4> User Flows </h4>
        <p> User flow reflects the user's journey from the launch of the application to the accessibility to all the different functionalities of the app </p>

        </picture>
        <h4> Wireframes </h4>
        <p> While paying close attention to native app design guidelines, I began creating low fidelity wireframes for both iOS and Android. These wireframes helped me build a visual foundation for the app. </p>

        <h4> Prototype Testing </h4>
        <p> After developing user flows and low-high fidelity wireframes, I created prototypes for both iOS and Android models and ran user testing. Their feedback helped me identify flaws in my designs that I would not have noticed myself. </p>

        <h3> UI </h3>
        <h4> Home Screen </h4>
        <p>The home screen gives an overview of what needs attention in the fridge. This helps users stay organized and lets the user know what products are expired and which ones are expiring soon. </p>

        </picture>
        <h4> Inside Your Fridge </h4>
        <p>The fridge page shows all the products inside the user's fridge. Here, the user can search for a specific product, or scroll through the different categories to view a list of their products. </p>

        </picture>
        <h4> Grocery List </h4>
        <p>Keep your house members' grocery list all in one place. Spoiled Milk does not only manage the products you have, but also the ones you need to buy. The app will also recommend groceries to buy if the user is lacking in healthy essential
          nutrients! </p>

        <h4> Let's Cook </h4>
        <p>Bought ingredients for only one recipe? Use those extra ingredients for a new recipe and you might find yourself a new favorite dish! Spoiled milk will deliver recipe inspiration based on the ingredients in your fridge. Find new recipes
          without the trip to the grocery store. </p>

        <h4> Invite Household Members </h4>
        <p>Easily share your fridge list and grocery list with your household members. Invited members can easily add new products to the fridge and add their needs to the grocery list. Now your kids wont tell you what they need when you come back
          from grocery shopping. All they need to do is add it to the shopping list and you will be notified right away! </p>

        <h2> Retrospective </h2>
        <h3> What Went Well </h3>
        <p> When beginning this case, I started with a simple concept of notifying the user of expired goods in their fridge. But as I went through the design process, I began to develop new ideas for the app to enhance the experience. This taught me
          to start a project with a simple concept that will help people's lives, then expand on that idea. </p>
        <h3>What didn't go well</h3>
        <p>Being an iPhone user my whole life, I found it easy to follow iOS guidelines and design Apple screens. On the other hand, developing material design screens was difficult for me because I'm not familiar with android phones. But
          nonetheless, after reviewing some android apps and borrowing a friend's android phone, I was able to become slightly more familiar with the design guidelines.</p>
        <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
        <p>Moving forward, I learned to have a clear vision of what problem my app solves, and use this to drive my design decisions. </p>
